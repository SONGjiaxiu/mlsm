####Overview####
- This paper presents an approach for bullying detection based on state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense knowledge base.

####Algorithm ####
- A number of natural language processing techniques are used for cyberbullying detection
 - Machine learning technique
  - Na√Øve Bayes, rule-based learner, tree-based learner, SVM
 - The open mind common sense knowledge base
  - ConceptNet
 - AnalogySpace inference technique
 - Blending knowledge combination technique

####Hypothesis####
The general hypothesis is that potentially bullying messages in social networks can be detected with natural language processing techniques. 

####Data####
- 1500 comments in Youtube labeled into three categories:  sexuality, race and culture and intelligence
- a dataset of anonymized instances of bullying that were either user-flagged or caught by their moderation team in Formspring

#### Experiment####
- They evaluate each statistical models and classifer against 200 unseen instances.
- Three metrics are computed
 - Accuracy
 - F1-score 
 - Kappa statistic
- They evaluate the reflective user interface strategy in a small user study with a mock conversation between three imaginary persons staged to present a bullying interaction.

####Results####
- The state-of-the-art natural language processing, augmented by common sense reasoning technique result in accuracies approaching 80% in identifying potentially bullying messages.

####Assumption####
- One assumption is that all cyberbullying messages can be classified into three categories:  sexuality, race and culture and intelligence

####Synthesis####
- Is there a bias introduced by not labeled the data with different categories?
- What is the accuracy if they evaluate a larger set of instances including both non-cyberbulling and cyberbullying messages in Formspring?
