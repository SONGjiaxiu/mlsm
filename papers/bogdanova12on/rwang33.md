#Overview
In this paper, they have suggested a list of high-level features, including sentiment and emotion based ones, for detection of online sexual predation. 

#Algorithm
They formulate the problem of detecting pedophiles
in social media as the task of binary text categoriza
tion: given a text (a set of chat lines), the aim is to
predict whether it is a case of cyberpedophilia or not.

#Hypothesis



#Data
* For our study, we have extracted chat logs from the perverted-justice website.
* We need additional chat logs to build the negative dataset. We used two negative datasets in our experiments: cybersex chat logs and the NPS chat corpus.
* We have extracted chat lines only for those adult authors who had more than 30 lines written. Finally the dataset consisted of 65 authors. From each dataset we have left 20 files for testing.
