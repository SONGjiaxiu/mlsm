Overview

This paper presents a research which to show the viral marketing is very useful in the person-to-person recommendation network.

Algorithm

They built stochastic model based on the data they have collected to show the relationship among those data. Such as the recommendation propagation model. 

Hypothesis

1. Most recommendation chains will be terminated in the initial purchase of a product.
2. The characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.
3. The category and price of product are affected the recommendation model.
4. The timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are shopping online or reading email.


Data

The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users. The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003. In
total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos. In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailer’s website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products. Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued.

Experiment

1. Take recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.
2. Estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward
3. Identifying cascades
Build the recommendation propagation model
Analyze the probability of purchasing as one gets not only one recommendations. 
6.Measure the effectiveness as two people exchange more and more recommendations
7.Study the recommendation network when the sender do a recommendation.
8.Find how long it takes a person to receive a recommendation and finally to buy it. 
9.Study the effectiveness of the books’ recommendation.
10. Built a model to show which product’s recommendations are more acceptable and the coefficients among them.

Results

1.  The probability of people purchasing something through the recommendation will decrease with repeated recommendation.
2. The probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but then stay in a  relatively low probability.
3.  People only can influence on some of the friends which around him.
4 .Different categories and different prices will make the effectiveness of recommendations different. 
5.  Smaller and more tightly organized groups tend to be more better to form a viral marketing.

Assumptions

They assume all customers get recommdations will purchase the product in a same retailer.
The recommendation propagation model assumes that each person who receive a recommendation will forward it to others if its value exceeds an arbitrary threshold that the individual sets for herself.

Synthesis

This paper is a very convincing paper. There are enough analysis to the experiment data, and it uses the figures and tables present the result directly, the steps of experiment are very clear, and the whole paper write in a reasonable way makes people easy to understand. Maybe just one point, the data are provided by the website of the retailer. And if a customer do not care the 10% credit, or he just forget this, he recommend the product to his friend, and his friend finally buy this product. So in this situation, the website of the retailer will not have a record of recommendation, but  there is no denying that the behavior of recommendation is exist.

This paper is only talk about the online booksellers, but our paper is about sales fo videos, DVDs, music and books. What’s more, the paper we read is mainly about  the effectiveness of the recommendation.

J. Chevalier and D. Mayzlin. The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews. 2004.

This paper also talks about online books sales, and it focused on the reviews of book affect the sales. But it has some differences between the recommendations and reviews. The former one will help the retailer sell products and bring you some benefits, but the lattter one only helps people estimate whether it is worthwhile to buy the item or not.
