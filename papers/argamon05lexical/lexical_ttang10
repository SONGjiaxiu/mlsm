Overview
This paper used four different sets of lexical features to capture the "personality type" from casual written text. They  addressed distinguishin g high from low neuroticism and extraversion in authors of informal text via a SMO learner.

Algorithm:
Four lexical feature sets:  a standard function word list, conjunctive phrases, modality indicators, and appraisal adjectives and modifier.
Support Vector Machine learner: SMO
10-fold cross-validation

Hypothesis:
We can determine “personality type” of the author from casual written text.

Data:
The corpus used for this experiment was derived from essays written by students at the University of Texas at Austin between 1997 and 2003. A stream-of-consciousness dataset and an dataset of deep self-analysis comprised 1157 and 1106 documents, respectively.

Experiments:
All documents in each corpus were processed into numeric feature vectors using various combinations of the four feature sets: function Word, Con, Mod, App. They used a SMO implementation from Weka and  examined the most important features for stylistic classification. They took the top features indicating each class and find all sibling oppositions (or simply ‘oppositions’) they gave. Then they compared 10-fold cross-validation accuracy for discriminating High from Low neurotics and extraverts in both the stream-of-consciousness (SoC) and deep self-analysis (DSA) writing tasks.
