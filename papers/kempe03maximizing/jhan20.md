####Overview####
- This paper formulates the problem of selecting the most influential nodes in social network as a discrete optimization problem and shows that the problem has the property of submodularity. 
####Algorithm ####
- For selecting the set of most influential nodes, a greedy hill-climbing that selecting the most influential node in current step is guaranteed to achieve (1-1/e) approximation.
####Hypothesis####
- The general hypothesis is that the influence function is monotone and submodular.
####Data####
- The co-authorship data in the high energy physics theory section of the e-print arXiv consisting of 10748 nodes and 53000 edges.
#### Experiment####
- For estimating the influence, they simulate the influence spread process 10000 times for each targeted set.
- They compare the performance of algorithms which select targeted nodes randomly, high-degree nodes, high-centrality nodes,  and greedy algorithm.  
####Results####
- The greedy hill-climbing algorithm performs best for selecting initial targeted set under both models. 
####Assumption####
- The nodes are only influenced by their neighbors inside the social network, so other influence sources are ignored. 
####Synthesis####
- We can extend the model to incorporate the time delay during the process of influence spread with a deadline constraint.
- We can design more efficient approximation algorithms to estimate the influence of a given target set. 
- We can also consider the influence source outside the social network, such as the newspaper, TV and other media.
