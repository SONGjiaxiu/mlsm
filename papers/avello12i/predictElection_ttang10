Comments
The author did not agree with most of the papers related to prediction for elections via using Twitter data. He came up with eight common flaws:
1. No predictive evidence in any paper at all.
2. Most paper didn't take the advantage of imcumbency into consideration while setting up the baseline.
3. No standard for how to "count" votes, or saying calculating scores from data.
4. No commonly accepted way to intepret so-called "reality", which implies the true figure in the real world.
5. We want the white-box classifiers instead of the black-box one. But the latter one is widely used.
6. The papers didn't rule out the untrusted tweets.
7. The demographic distribution is ignored, which may lead to a poor representative result.
8. All papers ignored that tweets on political topic are probably generated by those political active.

Recommendations
1. All the work claiming a predictive function should predict a future election in real world.
2. Take the degree of imcumbency into consideration and try to prove it better then the former baseline.
3. Clearly give a standard about what a "vote" is.
4. Clearly define a golden baseline of "truth".
5. We should use a reasonable sentiment analysis method instead of some simplistic assumptions.
6. Rule out all the disinformation and spammers.
7. The dataset should somehow represent the demographic.
8. Pay attention to the majority who are not talking.
