Overview
--------
They present a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and
susceptibility in networks while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion.

Algorithm
---------
The authors developed a hazard model to be their statistical approach. Survival models provide information about
how quickly peers respond (rather than simply whether they respond) and also correct for censoring of peer responses that may occur beyond the experiment’s observation window.

Hypothesis
----------


Data
----
A representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users

Experiments
-----------
They conducted a randomized experiment to measure influence and susceptibility to influence in the product adoption decisions of a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users. The experiment involved the random manipulation of influence-mediating messages sent from a commercial Facebook application that lets users share information and opinions about movies, actors, directors, and the film industry. As users adopted and used the product, automated notifications of their activities were delivered to randomly selected peers in their local social networks. At last they used a continuoustime single-failure proportional hazards model to estimate the moderating effects. 

Results
-------
* Men are more influential than women    
* Women influence men more than they influence other women     
* Older people (30+ years) are more influential and less susceptible to influence than younger people    
* Married people are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product they studied    
* Influence and susceptibility trade off, meaning people who were more influential tended not to be susceptible to influence and people who were susceptible tended not to be influential      
* Some people are clearly more influential than others and are themselves connected to other highly influential people, giving them the potential to be "super-spreaders"

Assumptions
-----------
* Highly influential individuals tend not to be susceptible, highly susceptible individuals tend not to be influential, and almost no one is both highly influential and highly susceptible to influence.      
* The “influentials” and “susceptibles” hypotheses are orthogonal claims.
* There are more people with high influence scores than high susceptibility scores. Targeting should focus on the attributes of current adopters  rather than attributes of their peers. 
* Influentials cluster in the network.
