#Overview
This paper addresses distinguishing high from low neuroticism and extraversion in authors of informal text with four different sets of lexical features.

#Algorithm
1. They use four different sets of lexical features for this task: a standard function word list, conjunctive phrases, modality indicators, and appraisal adjectives and modifiers.
2. SMO, a support vector machine learner, was used to learn linear separators for the high and low classes in each of the two tasks.
3. 10-fold crossvalidation was used throughout to estimate out-of-training classification accuracy.
