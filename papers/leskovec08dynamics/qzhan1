Overview
This article presents an analysis of a person-to-person recommendation network. Also, the authors observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which they explain by a simple stochastic model. The paper then establishes how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, this paper presents a model that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.

Algorithm
This paper presents a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.

Hypothesis
1. A person is more likely to buy a product if she gets more recommendations. On the other hand, if a person hasn’t bought a product after a number of recommendations, they are not likely to change their minds after receiving even more of them.
2. A person who recommends only a few products will have her friends’ attention, but one who floods her friends with all sorts of recommendations will start to loose her influence.
3. One would expect that recommendations would be the most effective when recommended to the right subset of friends. If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends, then the chances of success are slim. One the other hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with recommendations may have limited returns as well.

Data
The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users. The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003. In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos. In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailer’s website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products. Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).

Experiments
First, the paper examines how the probability of purchasing changes as one gets more and more recommendations. Next, this paper analyzes how the effectiveness of recommendations changes as two persons exchange more and more recommendations. And then the authors look from the viewpoint of the sender. They also study the time lag between the recommendation and the purchase of different product groups, effectively how long it takes a person to both receive a recommendation, consider it, and act on it.
