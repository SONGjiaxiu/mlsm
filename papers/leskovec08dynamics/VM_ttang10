Overview
This paper presented an analysis of a person-to-person recommendation network, involving 4 million people and 16 million recommendations on half million products. They observed the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which they explained by a simple stochastic model. They also explored the relationship between time period and effectivenees from the view of both sender and receiver of the recommendations. At last, they presented the difference of effcetiveness of recommendations among different categories of products.

Algorithm
A simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.

Hypothesis
1. Users may reflect to the recommendation differently.
2. For products of different groups, purchases and recommendations may present different characteristics.
3. The number of recommendations from one person on one product may affect the influence of recommendations.
4. Too many recommendations form one person may weeken the infulence of his/her recommendations.
5. Purchases and recommendations may show temporal features.
