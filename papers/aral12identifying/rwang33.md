Results
-------
-- Men are more influential than women    
-- Women influence men more than they influence other women     
-- Older people (30+ years) are more influential and less susceptible to influence than younger people    
-- Married people are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product they studied    
-- Influence and susceptibility trade off, meaning people who were more influential tended not to be susceptible to influence and people who were susceptible tended not to be influential      
-- Some people are clearly more influential than others and are themselves connected to other highly influential people, giving them the potential to be "super-spreaders"
