Overview

This paper presents a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and susceptibility in networks, at the same time avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion.


Algorithm
They use a hazards model, which is the standard technique for estimating social contagion in economics, marketing, and sociology. 

Hypothesis
They think the idea about the “influetials” that influential individuals catalyze the diffusion of opinions, behaviors, innovations, and products in society. 


Data
The experiment was conducted over 44 days during which 7730 product adopters sent 41,686automated notifications random from their 1.3million friends.
The resulted in 976 unique peer adoptions, or a 13% increase in demand for the product relative to the number of initial adopters.

Experiment

1. They do the research to find out the effects of age, gender, and relationship status on influence and susceptibility

They also build the dyadic influence models involving age, gender, and relationship status to help the research.

3. Their research find out Hazard ratios for individuals to adopt spontaneously as a function of their own attributes.


Results

1. In general, susceptibility will be decreased with age.
2. Women were less susceptible to influence than men.
3. Individuals in equally committed relationships relative to their peers.
4. People get the most influence on peers in the same age.
5. Different individuals play in the diffusion of a behavior during the affect.


Assumption
1. Highly influential individuals tend not to be susceptible, highly susceptible individuals tend not to be influential, and almost nobody is both highly influential and highly susceptible to influence.
2. The “influentials” and “susceptibles” hypotheses are orthogonal claims.
3. People are easy to influence others other than susceptible to influence by others.
4. There are a tendency for less susceptible users to cluster together and no clusters of highly susceptible users.



Synthesis

This paper is a well-organized paper, but in the Figure1 I have a question about it. People in different ages and different gender will have different life experience. Such as, we all know the age under 20 will be in a Rebellious youth. So it is obviously easy for those teenagers in this ages will be influenced by the product and the various kinds of advertisement through the social media and the influence from the peer. The main reason is the nature of human, not the effect of social media and peers. Maybe no one affect them, their curiosity will push them to buy something new or do other things. So I think it is a important factor, the writer maybe ignore it.

This paper mainly talk about the social media affect the adoption between people and product, but this paper it talk about the affect between people and people.

M. McPherson, L. Smith Lovin, J. M. Cook, Annu. Rev. Sociol.27, 415 (2001).

So this paper put all the focus on the people’s homophily in social network among. Those two papers have the similar part, but this paper have other direction and different research method.
