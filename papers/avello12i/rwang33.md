Overview
--------

From the title "I wanted to predict elections with twitter and all I got was this lousy paper", we can obviously see that at first the author still wanted use twitter data to predict the results of election. But after he went through lots of relevant papers in this field, he felt disappointed. So he lists the relevant papers and then points out these authors exaggerated the power of Twitter greatly. Each paper mentioned in the survey has its own flaw and weakness. After critiquing to all these papers, the author also come up with the conclusion and final recommendations.

Algorithm
---------

None

Data
----

In this survey, I think the data may be the relevant papers listed in the survey.

Experiments
-----------

None

Results
-------

Even there are amounts of useful information on Twitter, using the data of Twitter as the key factor to predict election is still inadvisable.
The author mentions the future research should take the flaws below into consideration:      
1. Not everybody is using Twitter.      
2. Not everyone twitterer is tweeting about politics.      
3. Just because it is on Twitter does not mean it is true.      
4. Naive is not bliss.      

Assumptions
-----------

None

Synthesis
---------

I quite agree with the author's standpoint. Needless to say, generalization is always the key obstacle we should overconme. As I went through these machine learning papers so far, I think the most difficult thing is to deal with the data.
People always choose profitable data to support their algorithms or methods. The post-hoc analysis mean nothing to me. Most authors like to claim positive results. And with the data they provide, the accuracy can even be up to 90%.
I wonder even can I restore their experiment. If I use the data they provide, what results can I get? If I do not use their data but other data such as Facebook, what results can I get then? Most of the methods just can handle one kind of data even only one database. Maybe this method is high efficient to the Twitter data in March. But if I substitute the data in April, can I still get a satisfactory results? Most possible answer to my questions may be no. I wonder whether Twitter is really a good database for prediction. I mean it can be used as an example to test methods, but can not stand as the key factor to generate algorithms or methods.
