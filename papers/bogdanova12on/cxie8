Overview:
They have suggested a list of high-level features, including sentiment and emotion based ones, for experiments on 
detecting pedophiles in social media with a binary classification by analyzing a corpus of predators’ chats from perverted
-justice data and two negative datasets of different nature: cybersex chat logs and NPS chat corpus.

Algorithm:
Naïve Bayes Classifier(to distinguish between predators and not predators)

Hypothesis:
·The list of features they suggest could be used to discriminate pedophiles from non-pedophiles.
·Low-level features could provide better results on NPS data than cybersex logs.

Data:
·5 subsets of chat logs from the perverted-justice website, each of which contained chat lines from 60 randomly selected 
predators(here they considered only the chat lines written by predators since victim is not real)
·34 one-on-one cybersex logs available at www.oocities.org/urgrl21f/ (here they separated lines of different authors and 
obtained 68 files)
·subset of NPS chat corpus(here they extracted chat lines only for those adult authors who had more than 30 lines written 
and got 65 authors)
·from each dataset they left 20 files for testing

Experiments:
·They created 5 subsets of PJ data to make the experimental data more balanced
·They used the author who wrote half of the chat sessions for training and the rest for testing
·They experimented with several baseline systems using low-level features based on n-grams at the word and character level
·They used Naïve Bayes classification applied to PJ-cybersex logs, PJ-NPS dataset

Results:
·The high-level features outperform all the low-level ones in both the cybersex logs and the NPS chat dataset and achieve 
94% and 90% accuracy on these datasets respectively, whereas low-level features achieve only 48-58% and 42-72% accuracy on 
the same data
·The high-level features yield a lower accuracy(90% accuracy) on PJ-NPS dataset than in case of PJ-cybersex logs(94% 
accuracy)
·All low-level features provide better results than on the NPS data than the cybersex logs except for the character 
bigrams
·In case of NPS chat dataset, bag of words only provides 61% accuracy and character trigrams provide the highest accuracy 
of 72% among the low-level features, which is still much lower than the high-level ones’ accuracy of 90%

Assumptions:
·Distinguishing cyberpedophiles is a harder task in case of cybersex logs than in case of the NPS data
·The NPS logs misclassified with the high-level features are more similar to cyberdopephiles training data than the 
training data of the NPS corpus

Synthesis:
Some points I think might be investigated for further research as follow
·to extract words with word sense disambiguation techniques
·to see whether merging low-level and high-level features could improve the accuracy 
·to explore the impact of each high-level features in order to see if simplification of the features
·to explore the minimum amount of training data needed
·to test the accuracy of these high-level features by using other datasets

They present a method for picking out sexual predators from a collection of online chats, and for identifying messages 
which are suggestive of predatory behavior. They found that while the lexical features and postprocessing were mutually 
helpful, their behavioral features failed to add significant discriminative power. However, a classifier trained on these 
features alone performed well above baseline.

They present a system for filename categorization, which is trained to identify suspicious files on P2P networks. In their 
initial experiments, they used regular pornography data as a substitution of child pornography. Their system separates 
filenames of pornographic media from the others with an accuracy that reaches 91–97%.
