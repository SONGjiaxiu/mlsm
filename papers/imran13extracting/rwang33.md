#Hypothesis
Given the importance of on-topic tweets for time-critical situational awareness, disaster-affected communities and professional responders may benefit from using an automatic system to extract relevant information from the Twitter.


#Data
The dataset consists of tweets posted during the Joplin 2011 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri in the late afternoon of Sunday, May 22, 2011. The dataset was originally constructed by researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The 206,764 unique tweets were selected by monitoring the Twitter Streaming API using the hashtag #joplin a few hours after the tornado hit. This monitoring process continued until the number of tweets about the tornado became particularly sparse.
