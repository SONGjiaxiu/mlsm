Overview
Instead of being concentrated on coarse-grained statistical analysis of populations, this paper focuses on fine-grained modeling of the spread of infectious diseases throughout a large real-world social network, by means of data mining of Tweeter data related to health condition. Moreover, this paper provides some quantifiable estimates of the characteristics of disease transmission on a large scale without active user participation.


Algorithm

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Hypothesis

1.	Social ties to infected, symptomatic people, as well as the intensity of recent co-location, sharply increase oneâ€™s likelihood of contracting the illness in the near future.
2.	Algorithm SVM can efficiently extract information related to health condition from Tweeter data.
3.	Furthermore, Our algorithm is capable of identifying friendship between two users, also recognizing the likelihood of the two hanging out recently.
