####Overview####
-This paper talked about how they find and confirm the potential relationships between people’s personality and their user activities and habits.

####Algorithm####
-First, they analyzed the features about the facebook users, they put users who got similar features into one group then they calculated the average trait scores of the groups, and they use linear regression algorithm to predict users’ personality trait by analyzing their user profile and activity habit.

####Hypothesis####
-The most important hypothesis is that facebook user’ personality can be detected by analyzing their user activities and profiles.

####Data####
-180000 users’ facebook profiles and personality scores that got from a popular app of facebook called myPersonality. And each feature got at least 15000 datapoints, most of them got more than 50000 datapoints.

####Experiment####
-By using a t-test and MWW, they detected statistical significance of correlations, then clustered users who got same personality features and predict personality feature by regression algorithm.

####Result####
-The best accuracy of such predictions is achieved for Extraversion and Neuroticism, the lowest accuracy is obtained for Agreeableness, with Openness and Conscientiousness lying in the middle. 

####Assumption####
-I think they did not use all the features they got, maybe because they did not have enough time to process a more complex pattern, personality is much more complicated than they described, if they really want to use it to predict people’s behaviors, it may be need to be more accurate. Maybe use common senses relations may help to get personality features from their daily facebook activities like comments or replies they made.

####Synthesis####
-They should use it to combine with current reference system, not substitute them, different personality may cause same interests.

This paper mainly talked about what kind of person would like to interact with others on web, it is a good view for the paper above that not all the people would like to interact with people on web, it means that maybe their test data pool is not sufficient to analyze personality, they may all belong to a big group called “people like on line interactions”.

Very similar with the paper we will discuss, difference is they provide a new type of social media which can help to get user information more easily.
