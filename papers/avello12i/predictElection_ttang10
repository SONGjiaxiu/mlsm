Comments
The author did not agree with most of the papers related to prediction for elections via using Twitter data. He came up with eight common flaws:
1. No predictive evidence in any paper at all.
2. Most paper didn't take the advantage of imcumbency into consideration while setting up the baseline.
3. No standard for how to "count" votes, or saying calculating scores from data.
4. No commonly accepted way to intepret so-called "reality", which implies the true figure in the real world.
