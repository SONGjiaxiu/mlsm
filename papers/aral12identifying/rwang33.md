Overview
--------
They present a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and
susceptibility in networks while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion.

Algorithm
---------
The authors developed a hazard model to be their statistical approach. Survival models provide information about
how quickly peers respond (rather than simply whether they respond) and also correct for censoring of peer responses that may occur beyond the experiment’s observation window.

Hypothesis
----------
Influential individuals catalyze the diffusion of opinions, behaviors, innovations, and products in society. 

Data
----
A representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users

Experiments
-----------
They conducted a randomized experiment to measure influence and susceptibility to influence in the product adoption decisions of a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users. The experiment involved the random manipulation of influence-mediating messages sent from a commercial Facebook application that lets users share information and opinions about movies, actors, directors, and the film industry. As users adopted and used the product, automated notifications of their activities were delivered to randomly selected peers in their local social networks. At last they used a continuoustime single-failure proportional hazards model to estimate the moderating effects. 

Results
-------
* Men are more influential than women    
* Women influence men more than they influence other women     
* Older people (30+ years) are more influential and less susceptible to influence than younger people    
* Married people are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product they studied    
* Influence and susceptibility trade off, meaning people who were more influential tended not to be susceptible to influence and people who were susceptible tended not to be influential      
* Some people are clearly more influential than others and are themselves connected to other highly influential people, giving them the potential to be "super-spreaders"

Assumptions
-----------
* Highly influential individuals tend not to be susceptible, highly susceptible individuals tend not to be influential, and almost no one is both highly influential and highly susceptible to influence.      
* The “influentials” and “susceptibles” hypotheses are orthogonal claims.
* There are more people with high influence scores than high susceptibility scores. Targeting should focus on the attributes of current adopters  rather than attributes of their peers. 
* Influentials cluster in the network.

Synthesis
---------
Although they avoid bias by randomizing message recipient selection and holding message content constant, recipient selection and message content may be important aspects of influence and should therefore be estimated in future experiments. In the future, our research should focus on examining how the codistribution of influence, susceptibility, and dyadic induction in networks affects the diffusion of behaviors, the development of social contagions, and the effects of policies intended to promote or contain behavior change.

Here they report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and realworld voting behaviour of millions of people.

This study scrutinizes the predictive relationships between social media and ﬁrm equity value, the relative effects of social media metrics compared with conventional online behavioral metrics, and the dynamics of these relationships. The results derived from vector autoregressive models suggest that social media-based metrics (Web blogs and consumer ratings) are signiﬁcant leading indicators of ﬁrm equity value.

Using a large database of 20 million users of mobile phone calls they show evidence this effect is not homogeneous in the social network but in fact, there is a large correlation between this effect and the social topological structure around a given individual.
