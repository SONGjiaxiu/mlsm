Overview
This paper is talking about detecting online sexual predators and suggested a list of  high-level features, including sentiment and emotion based ones, for detection of online sexual predation.

Algorithm
The authors borrowed several features from MCGhee et. al:
Percentage of approach words 
Percentage of relationship words
Percentage of family words
Percentage of communicative desensitization words
Percentage of words expressing sharing information

Hypothesis
Analysis of pedophiles’ personality characterizes them with feeling of inferiority, isolation, loneliness, low self-esteem and emotional immaturity. In general, pedophiles are less emotionally stable than mentally healthy people.
Data
Two negative datasets in our experiments: cybersex chat logs and the NPS chat corpus. 
They download the cybersex chat logs available at www.oocities .org/urgrl21f/.
Their dataset is imbalanced, the majority of the chat logs are from PJ. To make the experimental data more balanced, we have created 5 subsets of PJ corpus, each of which contained chat lines from 60 randomly selected predators.

Experiments
To distinguish between predators and not predators they used a Naïve Bayes classifier, already successfully utilized for analyzing chats by previous research.

Results
The high-level features outperform all the low-level ones in both the cybersex logs and the NPS chat datasets and achieve 94% and 90% accuracy on these datasets respectively. Excepting for the character bigrams, all low-level features considered indeed work worse in case of cybersex logs than NPS data.

Assumptions
The authors assumed that the chat is serious and without joking.

Synthesis
It is the first time that I meet this topic which makes me interesting. The future works should focus on predicting predators with shorter chat. That must be very useful for protecting youngers from online sexual predators.
